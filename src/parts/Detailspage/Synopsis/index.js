        Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where
        he lives with his Aunt May, under the watchful eye of his new mentor
        Tony Stark, Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine -
        distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your
        friendly neighborhood Spider-Man - but when the Vulture emerges as a new
        villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened.
